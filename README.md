# DataStructures-and-Java

1. Insertion Sort:
  The idea is to use the same logic as Sorting playing cards. Move an element as left as possible until, no other element is less than that element.  The solution uses 2 loops, which increases the computation time. Insertion sort is an inplace algorithm, i.e Swapping occurs with no external memory usage.
  
2. Hashset:
  An Attempt at building a HashSet Data structure using arrays.

3. InvertTree:
  To Invert a Binary Tree using recursion.  
  
 4. SearchBST:
  Search a Binary Tree for a node of a value and return the subtree of the node.

5. Trie:
  Trie is a DataStructure used for word completion and pattern recognition. It is constructed using Arrays and References. Though the memory space utilized is huge[O(number of nodes x number of references)], it is compensated by the low Time complexity [Insert: O(length of longest word x number of words) Search: O(length of the word x number of words)].

6. Level Order BST:
  Level Order BST is Essentially 
  
 7. ZigZag BST:
 
 8. Rotate Image:
 
 9. Build BST with inorder and postorder traversal:

10. Design of Browser History:
