# DataStructures-and-Java

### 1. Insertion Sort:
    The idea is to use the same logic as Sorting playing cards. Move an element as left as possible until, no other element is less than that element.  The solution uses 2 loops, which increases the computation time. Insertion sort is an inplace algorithm, i.e Swapping occurs with no external memory usage.
  
### 2. Hashset:
    An Attempt at building a HashSet Data structure using arrays.

### 3. InvertTree:
    To Invert a Binary Tree using recursion.  
  
 ### 4. SearchBST:
    Search a Binary Tree for a node of a value and return the subtree of the node.

### 5. Trie:
    Trie is a DataStructure used for word completion and pattern recognition. It is constructed using Arrays and References. Though the memory space utilized is huge[O(number of nodes x number of references)], it is compensated by the low Time complexity [Insert: O(length of longest word x number of words) Search: O(length of the word x number of words)].

### 6. Level Order BST:
    Level Order BST is Essentially a traversal method of bst that follows 
  
 ### 7. ZigZag BST:
    ZigZag BST is Essentially a traversal method of bst that follows
 
 ### 8. Rotate Image:
 
 ### 9. Build BST with inorder and postorder traversal:

### 10. Design of Browser History:

### 11. Regex Matching: Recursion

### 12. Tower Of Hanoi: 

### 13. Graph:
    Constructed a graph using adjacency list and traversed it using dfs. (TO DO: TRAVERSE IN BFS)
    
### 14. Min Stack:
    Built a minStack DataStructure that returns least value of the stack in minimum time (HOW? Using another stack that stores only the least values in it)
    
### 15. K Center Problem:
    This is DP based approximation Problem wherein the output returned is not an optimum solution but is close to it. This is done to reduce computation time by settling to a good enough solution instead of the best
