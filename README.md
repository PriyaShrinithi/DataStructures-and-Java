# DataStructures-and-Java

1. Insertion Sort:
  The idea is to use the same logic as Sorting playing cards. Move an element as left as possible until, no other element is less than that element.  The solution uses 2 loops, which increases the computation time. Insertion sort is an inplace algorithm, i.e Swapping occurs with no external memory usage.
  
2. Hashset:
  An Attempt at building a HashSet Data structure using arrays.

3. InvertTree:
  Inverting a Binary Tree using recursion.
